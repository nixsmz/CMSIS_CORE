History of updates to CMSIS_LPC18xx_DriverLib
=============================================

Important - the code in this project is targeted at the 
LPC18xx "Rev A" parts. It is not suitable for use with LPC18xx 
"Rev -" parts.

Note that this project provides both the basic CMSIS
headers, as well as NXP's LPC18xx peripheral driver 
code which sit on top of CMSIS.

14 January 2014
---------------
Updated version of lpc18xx_cgu.c/lpc18xx_cgu.h
Added call to CGU_Init(6) into SystemInit() function in system_LPC18xx.c

23 July 2013
------------
Renamed from CMSISv2p10_LPC18xx_DriverLib

Updated with ARM Cortex-M3 CMSIS files as supplied in ARM's
CMSIS 3.20 March 2013 release.

Updated to use code/headers from the LPC18xx CMSIS-Compliant 
Standard Peripheral Firmware Driver Library released by NXP 
through lpcware.com on 2012-12-12 (with minor mods made 
early in 2013). 

Files changed from NXP release include:

* lpc18xx_libcfg_default.h
  - Conditional modification to prevent redefinition of DEBUG macro
  
* lpc18xx_cgu.h, lpc18xx_can.c
  - Fixed case of ' #include "LPC18xx.h" ' for Linux compatibility.

    Red startup code.
  
  
26 September 2011
-----------------
Initial version of CMSIS 2.1 library project for
NXP's LPC18xx using ARM  Cortex-M3 CMSIS files as
supplied in ARM's CMSIS 2.1 July 2011 release, 
together with device specific files from NXP's 
LPC18xx CMSIS-Compliant Standard Peripheral Firmware
Driver Library (RELEASE: LPC1800CMSIS_20110627).

[Note some includes in driver library have had their
 case corrected so as to build on Linux : 
 lpc18xx.h -> LPC18xx.h ]
